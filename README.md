# HTTPServers
I'm making this project with the intention to implement very basic HTTP/1.1 servers in various programming language to get a feel of them in a more open and complex project.

I choosed an HTTP Server because a basic version of it can be implement fairly easily, while retaining a degree of challenge with all the various specification and variation that the HTTP standard has.

Right now only a very faulty and basic version in C is written, but I'm planning to extend it to make it stable and to try the same with other languages, in particular Rust and Zig.
I don't plan to use external libraries but I'm pretty sure at a certain point at least in C I will need them to make a good work.
